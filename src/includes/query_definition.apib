## STORED QUERY [/definition/query]

Management of stored (registered) queries in the system.

Stored queries must have a name (`qualified_query_name`) and an optional `version` number.

Implementers can choose a schema for query names, such as `<namespace>::<query-name>`, 
this way queries can be separated by domain, etc. 
Namespace (if used) should be reverse domain name, which allows for separation of 
stored queries by teams, companies, etc.
Example of a qualified query name: `org.openehr::compositions`.

In the future several standard openEHR stored queries might be developed, those will
use namespace `org.openehr`. 

Version numbers, if used must be in [SEMVER](https://semver.org/) style (i.e. `major.minor.patch`). 
If only a partial `version` is supplied or `version` is not supplied at all, the
system must use the latest `version` with the supplied prefix - i.e. if only `major` or `major.minor` 
is used, then the latest query version with supplied prefix will be used.

Queries can be executed using the [query endpoint](query.html#definitions-stored-query).

### List stored queries [GET /definition/query/{qualified_query_name}]

Parameter `qualified_query_name` is optional. If omitted they are treated as "wildcards" in the search.

Examples:
*   `GET {baseUrl}/definition/query/org.openehr` will list all versions of all
    queries with names starting with `org.openehr`
*   `GET {baseUrl}/definition/query/org.openehr::compositions` will
    list all versions of the query named `org.openehr::compositions`

+ Response 200 (application/json) 

    `200 OK` is returned when the query resources are successfully retrieved.
