= Experimental features

The following concepts and aspects are considered experimental.

[NOTE]

Implementers should treat its use as provisional and subject to change in future versions of this specification.

== Launch Parameter as a Token

To support efficient and context-rich embedded launches, it is *recommended* that the `launch` parameter be a **base64-encoded JSON object** containing launch context attributes such as:

- `ehrId` - The openEHR EHR identifier
- `patient` - FHIR Patient ID (if available)
- `episodeId` - Clinical episode ID (optional)

This allows the _Application_ to initialize its interface with full context and potentially bypass a full authorization cycle if it is already authenticated.
This significantly improves the user experience, for instance, when switching patients within the same embedded session.

Platforms that support this optimization should advertise the following capabilities in their `/.well-known/smart-configuration` response:

- `launch-base64-json`: May be used to deliver context (including `episodeId`) in a base64-encoded JSON format for embedded iFrame launches.


== Experimental: Episode Context

The *Episode* concept represents a bounded period of care or clinical workflow, such as a hospital admission, treatment course, or referral. It serves as a logical container for grouping related clinical activities, encounters, and observations. This concept is particularly relevant for workflows where context must be maintained across multiple interactions or systems.

In the context of SMART on openEHR, Episode selection and usage is considered **experimental**.
While the openEHR specification outlines the concept of an Episode, formal resource definitions and operational semantics are still evolving.
As the openEHR specification evolves to formalize Episode as a first-class resource, the following enhancements may be introduced:

- Standardized resource representation of an Episode type or new archetype.
- Extended query support for filtering by Episode.
- Improved UI/UX support in authorization servers for Episode selection.
- FHIR mapping for Episode-related concepts.

This section outlines the current capabilities and usage patterns under evaluation for Episode support.

=== Scopes and Capabilities

To request Episode context during an authorization flow, the following scope may be included in the authorization request:

[width="100%",cols="1,2",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Scope | Description
| `launch/episode` | Requests Episode context at launch time. If launching outside an EHR, prompts the _Platform_ to determine or allow selection of the Episode relevant to the session.
|=======================================================================

Platforms that support Episode context should advertise the following capabilities in their `/.well-known/smart-configuration` response:

- `context-openehr-episode`: Indicates that the _Platform_ supports Episode context selection during launch, requested via `launch/episode` scope.

=== Token Response Parameters

When an authorization request includes `launch/episode` scope and the Platform is capable of resolving the Episode, the following parameter will be included in the token response:

[width="100%",cols="1,2",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Parameter | Description
| episodeId | Identifier of the selected or inferred Episode for the session. This may map to an openEHR EHR_STATUS.episode or a platform-specific abstraction. Its semantics are currently implementation-defined.
|=======================================================================

This value is intended to be used by the client Application to filter or group clinical data relevant to the specific Episode of care.

=== Launch Scenarios

Standalone Launch:
When the `launch/episode` scope is included, the Platform may prompt the user to select an Episode or infer it automatically based on session context (e.g., currently admitted case, recent discharge summary, etc.).

Embedded iFrame Launch:
Episode context may be embedded in a base64-encoded `launch` parameter provided at runtime. This can improve usability by avoiding a separate Episode selection prompt during intra-portal navigation.
