= Conceptual Approach

== Background

The information models of openEHR are structured in multiple layers, with the primary distinction being between an information model layer (the 'Reference Model' or RM), and domain-level models expressed in archetypes and templates, that latter of which express particular data sets. Each such data set is defined in terms of an {openehr_am_opt2}[openEHR Operational Template (OPT)^], derived from a source template, and ultimately particular archetypes, which are themselves constraint models based on the RM, i.e. the 'canonical model.

The openEHR reference model (RM) and supporting models (BASE component) are designed with two computational goals in mind:

* data instances (healthcare data) are fully defined and self-standing when shared with a data partner that does not use openEHR;
* software that implements the model works in regular, expected ways; for example, the structure of the openEHR `OBSERVATION`, `HISTORY` and `EVENT` classes will generically represent any observation, from a single weight measurement to 100,000 samples of complex vital signs data.

The model is accordingly rigorous. However, for some developers who only need to instantiate, commit and/or read relatively limited data-sets, the canonical format can be demanding. This is particularly so for situations in which only a few kinds of data are implicated, i.e. a relatively small number of templates, e.g. vitals signs data, lab results etc.

The starting point for defining a developer-friendly commit format is therefore to assume that the great majority of applications are typically targetted to one or a few specific data sets, e.g. vital signs, diabetic monitoring, pregnancy plan etc. 

== Historical Formats

Template-specificity provides a route to simplification such that _each openEHR template_ can be used to define one or more reasonably simple commit formats. Three such formats in historical use are:

* _TDS, or Template Data Schema_, an XSD format originally devised by Ocean Informatics;
* _near-canonical RM Simplified Data Template (ncSDT)_, originally devised for the EtherCIS project, see https://github.com/ethercis/ethercis/blob/master/doc/flat%20json.md
* _simplified IM Simplified Data template (simSDT)_, based on the 'web template' format originally created by Marand for the Better platform, see https://www.ehrscape.com/examples.html

The web template format was originally based on the TDS, with a concrete expression in JSON and using paths, rather than sparse XML.

=== XML Schema Formats

The TDS format in historical use is defined by an openly available XSLT script that transformed `.oet` template source files and archetypes to a single XSD for any given template. The transformation flattened various RM structures to make them simpler to understand, and also converted archetype node codes (at-codes of Object nodes) to XSD tag names, e.g. 'serum_sodium'. This enabled developers to easily identify the XML Element for each data item they needed to populate to create a TDS instance document, known as a Template Data Document (TDD). The following is an extract of a TDD, which illustrates developer-friendly tags, in this case in Portuguese language.

=== JSON Formats

The first of the two JSON formats (ncSDT) is an extract from an Operational Template (OPT) that uses AQL-style paths (based on natural language independent codes like `at0001`), and apart from simplification of the `DV_XXX` and `PARTY_PROXY` types, retains the openEHR RM structure. An example is shown below.

}
--------

The latter (simSDT) is based on a more radical simplification of the openEHR RM and BASE models, as well as a more programmer-friendly (atural language based) rendering of paths. Under this approach, a lab result data structure could be represented using non-canonical, attribute or tag names such as 'serum_sodium', 'serum_potassium', etc (in English or in any other natural language, including script-based languages), instead of each node appearing under the canonical `CLUSTER._items_` attribute and codes like `at0001`. An example is shown below.

--------

*A developer just using the simSDT or ncSDT as illustrated above in a specific example-based use case does not need to understand the detailed steps of conversions described below.* Platforms based on openEHR can have services that generate example instances based on openeEHR templates to make work easier for such developers. The detailed descriptions below are primarily intended for developers creating and maintaining underlying openEHR platforms or dealing with complex use cases.

To make any form of 'simplified format' work, the following requirements must be met:

* the format makes it possible to _abstract away rigorous structural complexity_ of the canonical model where possible, mainly by making the data less self-standing, and relying more on a schema;
* the format definition for any given commit data can be completely and routinely _machine generated_ from its canonical definition, i.e. from an openEHR OPT, or other upstream canonical definition;
* data instances of the simplified format definition can be _routinely machine converted to canonical format_ at execution time.

== General Form of an Algorithm

A generic high-level algorithm for creating both kinds of data template definition from an Operational Template (OPT) is illustrated below.

[.text-center]
.Scheme for generation of JSON Template definitions
image::{diagrams_uri}/simplified_template_definition.svg[id=simplified_template_definition, align="center"]

In the above, both the near-canonical data and simplified data template definitions are created via a series of transformations starting with an OPT, followed by RM flattening, and then two stages of JSON format generation. The more heavily simplified form is created via an extra step, in which an original OPT is converted by the `sOPT transformer` to a _simplified OPT (sOPT)_, which is a regular-structured OPT, but whose underlying reference model is a _Simplified Information Model (SIM)_, based on the canonical Reference Model (RM) and related openEHR Information Models (Base, etc).

TODO: in fact, even the near-canonical data template has to be generated via a minimal sOPT step.

The SIM is approximately a _logical sub-set_ of classes relevant to the definition of EHR commitable content, with each class being a potentially simplified form of one or more classes in the RM. The simplifications may consist of:

* merging of Composition relationships (de-normalisation), which has the effect of reducing data path depth; i.e. in some cases, 2 RM classes are replaced by a single SIM class, which is relatively easy in the case of `0..1` and `1..1` relationships;
* stringification of specific attributes, i.e. replacement of (usually low-level) types with `String`, so that the attribute may contain a string form of a complex object.

These rules are formalised in the model-to-model Transformation rules shown above. Using the SIM and the rules, a Simplified OPT (sOPT) can be generated from any Operational Template (OPT), and from there, various concrete form JSON Data Templates (JDTs) may be generated, including regular JSON and 'flat form' JSON. Regular JSON is the usual sparse hierarchical structure where hierarchy follows data model. Flat form JSON is legal JSON, extracted from regular JSON by converting it to the logical model of the tuple `[path, leaf_data_item:Any]`, i.e. a logical 2-column table of path/value. In the generation of the regular JSON, paths can expressed in `AQL` (standard openEHR) format, or be converted to simplified format according to a small algorithm. The option to do this is shown in the JDT formatter in the diagram above.

Instances of both JSON regular and flat JDT formats can be created by developers to represent openEHR data to be committed to a system. These will be converted to canonical RM format (also obeying their original OPTs) by the simSDT -> RM converter on the server side at data commit time, as shown in the following diagram.

[.text-center]
.Scheme for conversion of Simplified Template instance to canonical form
image::{diagrams_uri}/simplified_template_data_conversion.svg[id=simplified_template_conversion, align="center"]

Following this scheme, this specification describes the Simplified Reference Model (SIM), Simplified OPT Transformer (sOPT Transformer), and the downstream JSON concrete formats and the ST -> canonical instance converter.
