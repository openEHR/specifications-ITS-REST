= Overview

== Introduction

The *Web Template (WT) serialization* format is a JSON-based representation of openEHR data instances that use simplified field identifiers instead of canonical archetype paths.
The format was originally developed by _Better d.o.o._ and has been adopted and extended by the _EHRbase_ open-source community as the *Simplified Data Template (SDT)* format.

Although _WT serialization_ and _SDT_ are historically different acronyms, in the context of this specification they serve the same purpose and can be used interchangeably.

The format has two primary variants:

* **simSDT** (simplified SDT) - colloquially known as "flat format"
* **structSDT** (structured SDT) - colloquially known as "structured format"

Key characteristics of the SDT format include:

* __Human-readable field identifiers__: Uses friendly names like `temperature|magnitude` instead of archetype paths like `/content[openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.body_temperature.v1]/data[at0002]/events[at0003]/data[at0001]/items[at0004]/value|magnitude`
* __Two structural variants__: simSDT (flat) and structSDT (structured) representations
* __Context data separation__: Clinical data separated from context metadata
* __Template-specific__: Field identifiers are specific to each operational template
* __Element-value simplification__: In flat format, there is no distinction between an ELEMENT and its value


== Scope

This specification covers:

* The structure and syntax of *simSDT* and *structSDT* formats
* Field identifier generation rules
* Context data representation
* RM attributes handling (underscore-prefixed attributes)
* Mapping between SDT format and canonical openEHR RM
* Serialization and deserialization requirements

This specification does not cover:

* Web Template itself as a resource
* Archetype technology and associated constraints
* Storage or indexing strategies


== MIME Types

Two MIME types are defined for the SDT serialization:

* __simSDT (flat)__ format: `application/openehr.wt.flat+json`
* __structSDT (structured)__ format: `application/openehr.wt.structured+json`


== Relationship to Other Specifications

The format relates to other openEHR specifications as follows:

* __openEHR Reference Model__: serialized instances represent valid RM structures (e.g. COMPOSITION)
* __Operational Templates (OPT)__: field identifiers are generated from OPT definitions
* __AQL__: serialized instances include AQL paths to enable query integration
* __Canonical JSON/XML__: SDT is an alternative serialization, convertible to canonical formats
