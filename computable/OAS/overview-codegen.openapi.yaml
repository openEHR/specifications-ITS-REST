      [comment]: # (title: Specifications)

      The openEHR REST specifications following service endpoints: 
       - [System API](system.html)
       - [EHR API](ehr.html)
       - [Demographic API](demographic.html)
       - [Query API](query.html)
       - [Definition API](definition.html)
       - [Admin API](admin.html)

      Specifications can be downloaded as YAML files in [OpenAPI Specification 3.0](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3) format.
      For each API there are two flavours provided: 
      - a file optimized for code generators, with the file name having the `-codegen.openapi.yaml` suffix; this file can be used with tools like [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator), or [Swagger codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen),
      - a file optimized for data validation, with the file name having the `-validation.openapi.yaml` suffix; this file can be used by (mock-)servers or applications to validate openEHR request and response payloads.

      The main difference between these files (aside of schema model names) is that the codegen flavour is defining and using inheritance in model schemas, with the use of `allOf` property and discriminators, whereas the validation variant is flattening all these requirements (each model contains all RM-inherited properties), and is using `oneOf` property to define union-types. See [Polymorphism](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3#composition-and-inheritance-polymorphism) specification. 

      The latest OpenAPI Specification files are available in GitHub at [openEHR/specifications-ITS-REST/computable/OAS](https://github.com/openEHR/specifications-ITS-REST/tree/master/computable/OAS).

    x-displayName: Requests and responses

      [comment]: # (title: Requests and Responses)

      The following describes in details how HTTP [headers](#tag/Requests_and_responses/HTTP-headers) and [status codes](#tag/Requests_and_responses/HTTP-status-codes) MUST be used by an openEHR REST API implementation to ensure effective interaction between services and clients in accordance with this specification.

      Additionally, general details about resources, [data representation](#tag/Resources/Data-representation) and content negotiation are described in this specification.

      > NOTE: Examples primarily use the **JSON** format. However, this does not imply that **XML** is unsupported by the same service endpoint.


      # HTTP Methods

      HTTP Methods are described by [RFC 9110](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-overview).
      The following subset is used in this specification:

      | Method  | Description                                                                              |
      |---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | GET     | Transfer a current representation of the target resource.                                |
      | HEAD    | Check existence of target resource and return the status, but does not transfer content. |
      | POST    | Perform resource-specific processing on the request payload.                             |
      | PUT     | Replace all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.     |
      | DELETE  | Remove all current representations of the target resource.                               |
      | OPTIONS | Describe the communication options for the target resource.                              |

      A server receiving an unrecognized or unimplemented method SHOULD respond with the `501 Not Implemented` status code.
      If a method is recognized but not allowed for the target resource, the response SHOULD be `405 Method Not Allowed` status code.


      # Authentication and authorization

      Services SHOULD implement and support an HTTP Authentication and Authorization framework, though this specification does not mandate a specific authentication scheme.
      See [RFC 9110](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-http-authentication) or [Mozilla's HTTP Authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication)
      for details on implementing an authentication and authorization.

      If authentication and authorization are required, services MUST properly use the `WWW-Authenticate` and/or `Proxy-Authenticate` response headers, returning `403 Forbidden`, `401 Unauthorized` or `407 Proxy Authentication` as applicable.
      Clients MUST send valid `Authorization` and `Proxy-Authorization` headers in their requests when required.


      # HTTP headers

      Standard HTTP request and response headers are defined by [RFC 9110](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9110) and the [IANA Message Headers Registry](http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml).

      This section outlines the subset of these headers used in the openEHR API, along with custom headers specific to openEHR.

      ## Deprecated headers

      [Prior to Release 1.1.0](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/ITS-REST/Release-1.0.3/overview.html#tag/Requests_and_responses/HTTP-headers), some openEHR custom headers included special characters that caused compatibility issues with HTTP standards. To ensure compliance and improve interoperability, these headers have been deprecated.

      While the deprecated headers remain available for backward compatibility, their use is strongly discouraged. The table below lists the updated header names alongside their deprecated counterparts:

      | Deprecated header     | New header            |
      |-----------------------|-----------------------|
      | openEHR-VERSION       | openehr-version       |
      | openEHR-AUDIT_DETAILS | openehr-audit-details |
      | openEHR-TEMPLATE_ID   | openehr-template-id   |
      | openEHR-uri           | openehr-uri           |
      | openEHR-EHR-id        | openehr-ehr-id        |

      For optimal compatibility, all new implementations should adopt the updated header names.

      ## openehr-version and openehr-audit-details

      When it comes to committing content to an openEHR system, for all change-controlled resources (e.g. COMPOSITION, EHR_STATUS, FOLDER, etc.) the services are [performing versioning](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/common.html#\_change_control_package) under the hood.
      The 'native' way of committing is to use a [CONTRIBUTION](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/common.html#\_contributions) and wrap the content as a [VERSION](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/common.html#\_version_class).
      To keep things simpler and consistent, services MUST also allow `PUT`, `POST` and `DELETE` methods directly on these change-controlled resources.
      However, these operations MUST internally be executed using the 'native' way.

      In order to allow clients to provide committal metadata, services MUST accept `openehr-version` and `openehr-audit_details` custom request headers.
      For clients, it is RECOMMENDED to provision these headers based on [authentication and authorization](#tag/Requests_and_responses/Authentication-and-authorization) runtime data.
      Below is a complex example of these request headers used in a `PUT` action to update a COMPOSITION:

      ```http
      openehr-version: lifecycle_state.code_string="532"
      openehr-audit-details: change_type.code_string="251"
      openehr-audit-details: description.value="An updated composition contribution description"
      openehr-audit-details: committer.name="John Doe",committer.external_ref.id="BC8132EA-8F4A-11E7-BB31-BE2E44B06B34",committer.external_ref.namespace="demographic",committer.external_ref.type="PERSON"
      ```

      None of these headers are mandatory, but whatever is provided it MUST be merged with the default VERSION and VERSION.audit_details attributes on commit runtime.

      The list of `code_string` values and their meaning is specified by the [Audit Change Type](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/TERM/latest/SupportTerminology.html#_audit_change_type) and [Version Lifecycle State](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/TERM/latest/SupportTerminology.html#_version_lifecycle_state) openEHR terminology vocabularies.

      ## openehr-item-tag

      The `openehr-item-tag` header is available all change-controlled resources (e.g. COMPOSITION, EHR_STATUS, FOLDER, etc.).

      Below is an example of this header:
      ```http
      openehr-item-tag: key="category",value="final"; key="flag",value="follow-up",target_path="/composition/start_time/value"
      ```

      Note that, this header acts as a convenient wrapper around dedicated ITEM_TAG actions (e.g. retrieving [COMPOSITION tags](ehr.html#tag/COMPOSITION/operation/composition_tags_get)), simplifying client interaction and reducing necessary API calls.
      If the server does not support ITEM_TAGs, this header will also be unsupported.

      #### Usage in Requests
      When used as a request headers for creation or update operations (`PUT`, `POST`), the header will instruct the system on which ITEM_TAG list should be associated with the target VERSION or VERSION_OBJECT resource.

      Providing an empty value for this header will effectively remove all ITEM_TAG associated with the given target.

      #### Usage in Responses
      Servers MAY add `openehr-item-tag` header to the response, to confirm the actual list as stored on server side.

      When retrieving resources viw `GET` methods, the server MAY also add `openehr-item-tag` response header that will contain the list of all ITEM_TAG associated with the target VERSION or VERSIONED_OBJECT.

      ## openehr-template-id

      The `openehr-template-id` request header MUST be used whenever committing COMPOSITION (via `PUT` or `POST` methods) using a [simplified data format](#header-alternative-data-formats) which does not support TEMPLATE_ID value under an equivalent `LOCATABLE.archetype_details.template_id` attribute of contained data.

      ## Location and openehr-uri

      The `Location` response header indicates the resource location (URL).
      According to [RFC 9110](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#field.location), it is used to refer to a specific resource in relation to the response.
      The type of relationship is defined by the combination of request method and status code semantics.
      The identifiers part of this URI-reference SHOULD comply with [resource identification](#tag/Resources/Resource-identification) semantics of this specification.

      Services MUST return this header whenever a create or update operation was performed, but it MAY
      return this header on other operation or action. Example:

      ```http
      Location: https://openEHRSys.example.com/v1/ehr/347a5490-55ee-4da9-b91a-9bba710f730e/composition/8849182c-82ad-4088-a07f-48ead4180515::openEHRSys.example.com::2
      ```

      See [representation details negotiation](#tag/Requests_and_responses/Representation-details-negotiation) section
      for more details on how use this header.

      ## openehr-uri

      If services have support to generate resource URI as specified by the [DV_EHR_URI](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/RM/development/data_types.html#_dv_ehr_uri_class) format, then they MAY also send `openehr-uri` response header for all openEHR resources where this is applicable.

      Example:

      ```http
      openehr-uri: ehr:/347a5490-55ee-4da9-b91a-9bba710f730e/compositions/87284370-2D4B-4e3d-A3F3-F303D2F4F34B
      ```

      ## Prefer

      The `Prefer` request header MAY be used by clients for resource representation negotiation.
      See more details on [representation details negotiation](#tag/Requests_and_responses/Representation-details-negotiation) section.

      ## ETag and Last-Modified

      The `ETag` and `Last-Modified` headers provide essential information about the state of a resource, enabling clients to manage caching, detect changes, and prevent unintentional overwrites.

      The `ETag` (Entity Tag) header acts as a unique identifier for a specific version of a resource. It helps clients determine whether a resource has changed between requests, supporting efficient caching and optimistic concurrency control.

      In this specification, the `ETag` value is independent of its serialization format (JSON/XML). This differs from standard HTTP behavior, where an `ETag` typically identifies a specific representation of a resource - see [RFC 9110](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#field.etag).
      The `ETag` value is usually taken from e.g. VERSIONED_OBJECT.uid.value, VERSION.uid.value, EHR.ehr_id.value, etc. It changes as soon as the resource changes (i.e. when a new version is created).

      An example of `ETag` header value format is:

      ```http
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      ETag: "8849182c-82ad-4088-a07f-48ead4180515::openEHRSys.example.com::2"
      ```

      Servers MAY add additional `ETag` response headers, consisting of an opaque quoted string, possibly prefixed by a weakness indicator.

      The `Last-Modified` response HTTP header, indicates the date and time when the resource was last modified.
      This helps clients determine freshness and manage conditional requests.
      For openEHR resources, this value should be derived from VERSION.commit_audit.time_committed.value.

      An example of `Last-Modified` header value format is:

      ```http
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Last-Modified: Wed, 22 Jul 2009 19:15:56 GMT
      ```

      Both `ETag` and `Last-Modified` SHOULD be included in responses for VERSION, VERSIONED_OBJECT, or other resources that have versioning or unique state identifiers.

      ## If-Match and accidental overwrites

      The `If-Match` request header SHOULD be used by the clients with state-changing methods (e.g., `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) to prevent accidental overwrites when multiple user agents might be acting in parallel on the same resource (i.e., to prevent the "lost update" problem). This is only required by a small set of versioned resources in this specification.
      If a service receives this header, and the condition evaluates to `false`, it MUST NOT perform the requested method. Instead, it MUST respond with HTTP status code `412 Precondition Failed`, and SHOULD return also latest `version_uid` in the `Location` and `ETag` response headers. When the service expects `If-Match` for an operation, but the client does not provide it, the service SHOULD respond with `400 Bad Reequest`. 

      Example:
      ```http
      If-Match: "8849182c-82ad-4088-a07f-48ead4180515::openEHRSys.example.com::2"
      ```

      See also details for `If-Match` described by [RFC 9110](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-if-match).


      # HTTP status codes

      HTTP Status codes are described by [RFC 9110](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-status-codes) and by the [IANA Status Code Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml).
      The following subset of the is used in this specification:

      | Code | Reason-Phrase          | Meaning, usecase and details                                                                                                                                               |

      To indicate the status of a request or operation, an appropriate HTTP status code MUST be used as described above. Additional status codes MAY be used as long as they do not conflict with the predefined codes.

      Status code `400` indicates normally a bad request, as well as a generic client-side error, used when no other `4xx` error code is appropriate.
      The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without modifications.

      For `4xx` and `5xx` status codes, services MAY return additional error details if the `Prefer: return=representation` header is present in the request.
      Example error response:

      ```json
      {
          "message": "Error message",
          "code": 90000,
          "errors": [
              {
                  "_type": "DV_CODED_TEXT",
                  "value": "Error message",
                  "defining_code": {
                      "terminology_id": {
                          "value": "local"
                      },
                      "code_string": "9000"
                  }
              },
              {
                  "_type": "DV_CODED_TEXT",
                  "value": "Secondary error message",
                  "defining_code": {
                      "terminology_id": {
                          "value": "local"
                      },
                      "code_string": "8000"
                  }
              }
          ]
      }
      ```

      # Representation details negotiation

      When using `POST` or `PUT` to create or update a resource, the client can specify its response preference using the `Prefer` header, as described in [RFC 7240, Section 4.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7240#section-4.2).

      ## Minimal or full representation response

      Clients MAY choose any of the following:

      - send `Prefer: return=minimal` to inform the service that prefers only a minimal response to a successful request.
        A `Location` header indicating the direct URL to access the resource MUST be part of the service response.
        If there is no payload content to be returned, the service SHOULD use HTTP status code `204 No Content`.

      - send `Prefer: return=representation` to inform the service that prefers a full representation response to a successful request.
        The `Location` header indicating the direct URL to access the resource representation MAY be part of the service response, and the payload content SHOULD include a full representation, while HTTP response status code is usually `201 Created`.

      If no `Prefer` header is specified, the default behavior is `return=minimal`.

      ## Resolving Object References

      Clients can request with `Prefer: resolve_refs` that object references (OBJECT_REF) be resolved into full or partial representations instead of being returned as references:

      ```http
      Prefer: return=representation, resolve_refs
      ```

      This is useful when retrieving lists of COMPOSITION resources within an EHR, where the default behavior is to return only references.
  - name: Resources
    description: |
      [comment]: # (title: Resources)

      For the openEHR API, a **resource** is an instance object of a specific openEHR class (type) that can be identified, addressed, handled or managed by the service.
      Examples of openEHR resources include:

      - top-level content structure: COMPOSITION, EHR_STATUS, FOLDER, PARTY, etc.
      - versioned entities: VERSIONED_COMPOSITION, VERSIONED_EHR_STATUS, etc. or their contained VERSION instances.
      - non-versioned resources: EHR, CONTRIBUTION, RESULT_SET, etc.
      - definitions: TEMPLATE, ARCHETYPE, QUERY.

      In this specification, types defined by openEHR are always capitalized. 
      For a complete list of available types, refer to the [class index](https://specifications.openehr.org/classes).

      # Resource identification

      A key aspect of a RESTful service is the ability to address resources via URIs/URLs using HTTP methods.
      Each resource has a unique identifier within the system for its type, typically including a globally unique identifier and, in some cases, a version identifier.
      Once assigned, a resource identifier remains unchanged throughout its lifetime.

      ## Identifier types

      Depending on the resource type and use case, different identifiers (and formats) are used:

      - a `versioned_object_uid` for identifying a VERSIONED_OBJECT (i.e. a version container), stored under VERSIONED_OBJECT.uid.value, in a form of a HIER_OBJECT_ID,
      - a `version_uid` for identifying a VERSION from the version container, stored under VERSION.uid.value, in a form of an OBJECT_VERSION_ID,
      - an `ehr_id` to identify an EHR,
      - a `template_id` to identify a Template definition.
      - a `qualified_query_name` to identify Query definition.

      The `version_uid` uniquely identifies a VERSION, in the lexical form of `object_id :: creating_system_id :: version_tree_id`. Here, the `object_id` matches the VERSIONED_OBJECT identifier, taken from VERSIONED_OBJECT.uid.value (i.e. the `versioned_object_uid`).

      Consider the following request:

      ```http
      GET https://openEHRSys.example.com/v1/ehr/7d44b88c-4199-4bad-97dc-d78268e01398/composition/8849182c-82ad-4088-a07f-48ead4180515::openEHRSys.example.com::1
      ```

      - the EHR identifier is `7d44b88c-4199-4bad-97dc-d78268e01398`, taken from EHR.ehr_id.value,
      - the COMPOSITION identifier `8849182c-82ad-4088-a07f-48ead4180515::openEHRSys.example.com::1`, taken from COMPOSITION.uid.value, which also implies that the VERSIONED_OBJECT identifier is `8849182c-82ad-4088-a07f-48ead4180515` and the latest version is `1`,
      - the request is made to an openEHR API (of version `v1`), located at `https://openEHRSys.example.com`.

      > NOTE: Since [RM Release 1.0.4](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/RM/Release-1.0.4) it is strongly recommended that the inherited attribute `uid` attribute in COMPOSITION objects be populated using the `uid` copied from the enclosing VERSION object.
        For example, if an ORIGINAL_VERSION.uid is `87284370-2D4B-4e3d-A3F3-F303D2F4F34B::uk.nhs.ehr1::2`, then this value should be copied to the COMPOSITION.uid attribute.
        See [Levels of identification](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/BASE/latest/architecture_overview.html#\_levels_of_identification) section of Architecture Overview for more details.

      ## Multiple identifiers for the same resource

      There are circumstances when openEHR resources can be uniquely identified by two different identifiers. 
      For example, if a VERSIONED_COMPOSITION container has the _versioned_object_uid_ identifier `8849182c-82ad-4088-a07f-48ead4180515`, and the latest version is `5` (taken from _version_tree_id_), then the COMPOSITION can be accessed using either:

      ```http
      GET https://openEHRSys.example.com/v1/ehr/7d44b88c-4199-4bad-97dc-d78268e01398/composition/8849182c-82ad-4088-a07f-48ead4180515::openEHRSys.example.com:5
      ```

      as **explicit version reference**, using the _version_uid_ identifier,

      ```http
      GET https://openEHRSys.example.com/v1/ehr/7d44b88c-4199-4bad-97dc-d78268e01398/composition/8849182c-82ad-4088-a07f-48ead4180515
      ```
      as **implicit latest version reference**.

      However, the implicit URI will only resolve to the same resource as the explicit versioned URI as long as no new versions are created (i.e. the latest version remains `5`).


      # Data representation

      Services MUST support at least one of the openEHR **XML** or **JSON** formats for resource representation.
      Additionally, alternative formats, such as the **Simplified Data Template (SDT)** format, MAY be supported.
      The supported formats and their negotiation protocols are described below.

      ## XML Format

      When resources are serialized in XML format, both request payloads and responses MUST conform to the [published XSDs](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/ITS-XML/latest).

      A client MAY use the header `Content-Type: application/xml` in the requests to specify the XML payload format.
      If the service cannot process the request payload as XML format is not supported, it MUST respond with HTTP status code `415 Unsupported Media Type`.

      The client SHOULD use the `Accept: application/xml` request header in order to specify the expected XML response format.
      If the service cannot fulfill this aspect of the request, it MUST respond with HTTP status code `406 Not Acceptable`.
      Proper header `Content-Type: application/xml` MUST be present in the response of the service
      unless the response has no content body (HTTP status code `204`).

      ## JSON Format

      When resources representation is serialized as JSON, the request payload as well as the result SHOULD be valid against [published JSON-Schemas](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/ITS-JSON/latest).

      > NOTE: The JSON-Schema project is under development.

      Attribute names must be lowercase _snake_case_ names as specified in the equivalent RM type. For example:

      ```json
      {
          "category": {
              "value": "event",
              "defining_code": {
                  "terminology_id": {
                      "value": "openehr"
                  },
                  "code_string": "433"
              }
          }
      }
      ```

      Metadata attributes (those that are not also RM attributes) will always be prefixed by a `'_'`.

      One example is the `_type` attribute, which should be used to specify the RM type whenever polymorphism is involved, or when the underlying definition in RM type is abstract (dynamic type is different from the static type).
      This follows same rule as for XML typing.
      The value of this attribute MUST be the uppercase class name from the RM specification. For example:

      ```json
      {
          "_type": "DV_TEXT",
          "value": "Hello world!"
      }
      ```

      The RM attributes (even required ones) that are `Null`, empty list or empty arrays SHOULD be absent when serialized as JSON.

      The order of attributes in the resource MAY follow the order of attributes in the RM specification of the type of the resource, but this is not mandatory.

      A client MAY use the header `Content-Type: application/json` in the requests to specify the JSON payload format.
      If the service cannot process the request payload as JSON format is not supported, it MUST respond with HTTP status code `415 Unsupported Media Type`.

      The client SHOULD use the `Accept: application/json` request header in order to specify the expected JSON response format.
      If the service cannot fulfill this aspect of the request, it MUST respond with HTTP status code `406 Not Acceptable`.
      Proper header `Content-Type: application/json` MUST be present in the response of the service unless the response has no content body (HTTP status code `204`).

      ## Alternative data formats

      Creating data instances according to canonical XML or JSON format is not always straightforward, particularly for developers with minimal exposure to openEHR, and various alternatives have been used in the past to simplify the job of content creation and committal for application developers.

      ### Simplified Data Template formats

      There is an initiative exploring and documenting these alternative formats, which specifications can be consulted at [Simplified Data Template (SDT)](simplified_data_template.html) page.

      > NOTE: The specification of Simplified Data Template is under development.

      In order to use these formats, content negotiation SHOULD be done in the same manner as for the canonical XML or JSON format above, but instead of `application/xml` or `application/json`, clients and servers MUST use:

      - `application/openehr.wt.flat+json` for the simplified IM Simplified Data Template (simSDT) as JSON,

      based on the 'FLAT' version of the ['web template' format](https://www.ehrscape.com/reference.html), originally created by Marand for the Better platform.
      More information can be found also in their ['examples'](https://www.ehrscape.com/examples.html) page, as well as in their [open-source implementation](https://github.com/better-care/web-template) and [conformance tests](https://github.com/better-care/web-template-tests).

      EHRbase also has support for this format, and provides information in their [documentation](https://docs.ehrbase.org/docs/EHRbase/openEHR-Introduction/Load-Data#flat-format).

      - `application/openehr.wt.structured+json` for the structured IM Simplified Data Template (structSDT) as JSON,

      based on the 'STRUCTURED' version of the ['web template' format](https://www.ehrscape.com/reference.html) originally created by Marand for the Better platform (see also their ['examples'](https://www.ehrscape.com/examples.html)).

      ### Legacy or experimental formats

      - `application/openehr.nc.flat+json` for near-canonical RM Simplified Data Template (ncSDT) as JSON, based on the

      [ECISFLAT format](https://github.com/ethercis/ethercis/blob/master/doc/flat%20json.md), originally devised for the EtherCIS project,

      - `application/openehr.tds2+xml` for TDS simplification of RM as XML,

      based on the 'TDS/TDD' format originally created by [Ocean Health Systems](http://oceanhealthsystems.com/) (see [this wiki page](https://openehr.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/spec/pages/30408770/Template+Data+Schema+TDS+Specification+and+associated+Template+Data+Document+TDD) and the [TDD2canonical](https://github.com/openEHR/openEHR-TDD2canonical) project).

      > NOTE: Other alternative formats may be added in the future, depending on innovative impact, simplicity, popular demand or adoption rate.

      Current alternative formats might not be supported once they become obsolete or superseded by newer formats.

      A client MAY use the header `Content-Type` in the requests to specify the simplified payload format.
      If the service cannot process the request payload as the simplified format is not supported, it MUST respond with HTTP status code `415 Unsupported Media Type`.

      The client SHOULD use the `Accept` request header in order to specify the expected simplified response format.
      If the service cannot fulfill this aspect of the request, it MUST respond with HTTP status code `406 Not Acceptable`.
      Proper header `Content-Type` MUST be present in the response of the service
      unless the response has no content body (HTTP status code `204`).

      ## Datetime format

      The format of the date, time and datetime types should comply with the [ISO 8601 Date and Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_8601) format specification.
      The ISO 8601 semantics assumed by openEHR is defined in the classes of the [base.foundation_types.time package](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/BASE/latest/foundation_types.html#\_time_types).
      It is strongly recommended using the _extended_ format for dates, times and datetimes.
      This greatly aids human readability, and reduces the need for special date/time parsing and formatting.

      HTTP query parameters and path segments that are dates, datetimes, or times, MUST always use the _extended_ ISO 8601 format.
      The general form of a datetime is `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sss[Z|±hh:mm]`, e.g. `2016-06-23T13:42:16.117+02:00`.\
      Timezone SHOULD be only supplied when needed, otherwise the local timezone is assumed.

      Any date, datetime or time value provided as part of the HTTP message body, when creating or updating a resource (e.g. a DV_DATE_TIME value inside the COMPOSITION content), will be preserved as it was sent by the client, and passed to the underlying backend engine as is.
      Retrieval or querying those resources SHOULD return date, datetime, or time values in the (original) format provided by underlying backend engine, avoiding any format change.
