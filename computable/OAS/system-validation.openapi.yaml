      summary: Options and Conformance
      description: |
        The `OPTIONS` HTTP method allows a client to determine the options and/or requirements associated with a resource, service or with the system, without implying a resource action.

        Services SHOULD respond to this method with the appropriate HTTP codes, headers and potentially with a payload revealing more details about themselves.

        Another use-case for this method is related to exposing service capabilities for a conformance manifest.
