summary: Options and Conformance
description: |
  The `OPTIONS` HTTP method allows a client to determine the options and/or requirements associated with a resource, service or with the system, without implying a resource action.
  
  Services SHOULD respond to this method with the appropriate HTTP codes, headers and potentially with a payload revealing more details about themselves.
  
  Another use-case for this method is related to exposing service capabilities for a conformance manifest.
