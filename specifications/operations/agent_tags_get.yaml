operationId: agent_tags_get
summary: Get AGENT tags
description: |
  Retrieves the list of all ITEM_TAG resources associated with a given target AGENT version or VERSIONED_PARTY identified by `uid_based_id`.

  The `uid_based_id` can take a form of an OBJECT_VERSION_ID identifier taken from VERSION.uid.value (i.e. a `version_uid`), 
  or a form of a HIER_OBJECT_ID identifier taken from VERSIONED_PARTY.uid.value (i.e. a `versioned_object_uid`).
  The former is used to get the tags of a particular (target) version of the AGENT version (e.g. one identified by `8849182c-82ad-4088-a07f-48ead4180515::openEHRSys.example.com::1`),
  whereas the latter (e.g. an identifier like `8849182c-82ad-4088-a07f-48ead4180515`) is be used to get the tags of the target VERSIONED_PARTY container, 
  which semantically are equivalent to tags targeting the latest version.
  
  This will return an empty list when there is no ITEM_TAG associated with the given target.
    
  More than one ITEM_TAG may be associated with a single target AGENT or VERSIONED_PARTY, in which case they are uniquely identified 
  by their `key` and `target_path` pair attributes.
