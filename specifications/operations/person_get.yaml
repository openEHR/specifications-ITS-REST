operationId: person_get
summary: Get PERSON
description: |
  Retrieves a version of the PERSON identified by `uid_based_id`.

  The `uid_based_id` can take a form of an OBJECT_VERSION_ID identifier taken from VERSION.uid.value (i.e. a `version_uid`), or a form of a HIER_OBJECT_ID identifier taken from VERSIONED_OBJECT.uid.value (i.e. a `versioned_object_uid`).
  The former is used to retrieve a specific known version of the PERSON (e.g. one identified by `8849182c-82ad-4088-a07f-48ead4180515::openEHRSys.example.com::1`), whereas the later (e.g. an identifier like `8849182c-82ad-4088-a07f-48ead4180515`) is be used to retrieve a version from the version container whenever the _version_tree_id_ is unknown or irrelevant (such as when most recent version is requested).
  
  When the `uid_based_id` has the form of a HIER_OBJECT_ID, if the `version_at_time` is supplied, retrieves the version extant _at specified time_, otherwise retrieves the _latest_ PERSON version.

  See [Resource identification](overview.html#tag/Resources/Resource-identification) for more details about the identifiers usage and meaning.
  
  When there are ITEM_TAGs associated with the retrieved PERSON, they will be returned as `openehr-item-tag` and `openehr-version-item-tag` response headers, respectively - see [item tags headers](overview.html#tag/Requests_and_responses/HTTP-headers/openehr-item-tag-and-openehr-version-item-tag) for more details.
