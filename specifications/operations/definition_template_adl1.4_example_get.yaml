operationId: definition_template_adl1.4_example_get
summary: Get example data by template
description: |
  Generates and retrieves an example data instance based on an ADL 1.4 operational template (OPT) identified by the `template_id` parameter.
  
  The generated example can be either of type `input` (i.e., ready to be submitted to the repository) or `output` (as it would appear when retrieved from the repository).
  This behavior is controlled by the `type` query parameter.
  
  The level of detail in the generated example can be customized using the `detail_level` query parameter.
  It affects the number and complexity of nested elements, the inclusion or exclusion of optional elements, and the depth of data point details.
  The supported values are:
  - `required`: a minimal composition including only mandatory data points; intended for training purposes and expected to be committable without adjustment
  - `medium`: a fairly realistic set of data points, including some optional RM attributes and elements; intended to be committable (e.g., it should not contain more than one choice element, even if the template allows it)
  - `complete`: a full representation of all possible data points; not expected to be committable or realistic, and intended as reference guidance for how parts of the RM should be represented
  
  > NOTE: The implementation and completeness of these examples are not specified, and vendors may produce different results.
  These examples are intended as pedagogical tools; their output should not be used in production.

  When the server does not support the requested `type` or `detail_level`, it will fall back to the closest supported level, or it may return an error (typically `404 Bad Request`).
  
  The format of the returned data instance can be controlled via the `Accept` header. See the [data representation specification](overview.html#tag/Resources/Data-representation) for supported formats.tags:
