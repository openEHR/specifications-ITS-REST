operationId: composition_update
summary: Update COMPOSITION
description: |
  Updates COMPOSITION identified by `uid_based_id` and associated with the EHR identified by `ehr_id`.
  
  The `uid_based_id` can take only a form of an HIER_OBJECT_ID identifier taken from VERSIONED_OBJECT.uid.value (i.e. a `versioned_object_uid`).

  If the request body already contains a COMPOSITION.uid.value, it must match the `uid_based_id` in the URL. 

  The existing latest `version_uid` of COMPOSITION resource (i.e. the `preceding_version_uid`) must be specified in the `If-Match` header.
  
  A list of ITEM_TAGs can be associated with the updated COMPOSITION, in which case a `openehr-item-tag` request header is needed to be set as well. 
  The corresponding response header will return ITEM_TAGs as they were set by the server.
