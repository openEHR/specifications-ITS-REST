summary: Create EHR
description: |
  Create a new `EHR` with an auto-generated identifier.

  An EHR_STATUS resource needs to be always created and committed in the new EHR.
  This resource MAY be also supplied by the client as the request body. 
  If not supplied, a default EHR_STATUS will be used by the service with following attributes:
    - `is_queryable`: true
    - `is_modifiable`: true
    - `subject`: a PARTY_SELF object

  All other required EHR attributes and resources will be automatically created as needed by the [EHR creation semantics](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/ehr.html#_ehr_creation_semantics).
