operationId: ehr_create_with_id
summary: Create EHR with id
description: |
  Create a new EHR with the specified `ehr_id` identifier.

  The value of the `ehr_id` unique identifier MUST be valid [HIER_OBJECT_ID](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/BASE/latest/base_types.html#_hier_object_id_class) value. 
  It is strongly RECOMMENDED that an UUID always be used for this.

  An EHR_STATUS resource needs to be always created and committed in the new EHR.
  This resource MAY be also supplied by the client as the request body. 
  If not supplied, a default EHR_STATUS will be used by the service with following attributes:
    - `is_queryable`: true
    - `is_modifiable`: true
    - `subject`: a PARTY_SELF object

  All other required EHR attributes and resources will be automatically created as needed by the [EHR creation semantics](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/ehr.html#_ehr_creation_semantics).
