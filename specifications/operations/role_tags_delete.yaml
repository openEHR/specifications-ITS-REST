summary: Delete ROLE tags
description: |
  Deletes the ITEM_TAG resource(s) identified by `tag_key`, associated with a given target ROLE version or VERSIONED_PARTY identified by `uid_based_id`.

  The `uid_based_id` can take a form of an OBJECT_VERSION_ID identifier taken from VERSION.uid.value (i.e. a `version_uid`),
  or a form of a HIER_OBJECT_ID identifier taken from VERSIONED_PARTY.uid.value (i.e. a `versioned_object_uid`).
  The former is used to delete the tags a particular (target) version of the ROLE version (e.g. one identified by `8849182c-82ad-4088-a07f-48ead4180515::openEHRSys.example.com::1`),
  whereas the later (e.g. an identifier like `8849182c-82ad-4088-a07f-48ead4180515`) is be used to delete the tags of the target VERSIONED_PARTY container,
  which semantically are equivalent to tags targeting the latest version.
